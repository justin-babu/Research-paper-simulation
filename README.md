# Simulated Stock Trading using Neural Networks and Random Forest | Course Project | Prof. Thirumulanathan Dhyaparan

    # Aim:

    * Simulated research paper 'Stock Closing Price Prediction using Machine
Learning Techniques.' for Nike, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, J & J and
Pfizer stocks

    # Approach:

    * Employed ANN and Random Forest algorithms to predict closing prices of
above stocks
    * Extended research simulation by using predictions to trade using
strategy: 'buy if price rises for 4 consecutive days, sell if it
decreases for 1 day (and we have a profit)

    # Result:

    * Used RMSE, MAPE, MBE to assess model performance with upto 97% and 36%
accuracies for ANN and Random Forest
    * Made profits of upto 27% and 6% using ANN and Random Forest.
