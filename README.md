# Simulated Stock Trading using Neural Networks and Random Forest | Course Project | Prof. Thirumulanathan Dhyaparan

### Aim:

* Simulated research paper 'Stock Closing Price Prediction using Machine Learning Techniques.' for Nike, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, J & J and Pfizer stocks

### Approach:

* Employed ANN and Random Forest algorithms to predict closing prices of above stocks
* Extended research simulation by using predictions to trade using strategy: 'buy if the price rises for 4 consecutive days, sell if it decreases for 1 day (and we have a profit)

### Result:

* Used RMSE, MAPE, MBE to assess model performance with upto 97% and 36% accuracies for ANN and Random Forest
* Made profits of upto 27% and 6% using ANN and Random Forest.

### Files: 
* Stock Closing Price Prediction using Machine Learning Techniques.pdf - research paper that we have simulated.
* Extension 1.ipynb - Jupyter notebook that contains the workings of an extended version of our research paper using data from 5th April 2009 to 5th April 2022. (Attempts were made to obtain pre-2009 data, but this was not available) The original paper uses data from 5th April 2009 to 5th April 2019.
* Paper Replication and Extension 2.ipynb - Jupyter notebook containing the workings of the replication of the research paper along with the implementation of a basic trading strategy using obtained predictions.
* Presentation.pptx and Presentation.pdf - Files presented as part of course project
* Table.xlsx - contains results of all procedures.
